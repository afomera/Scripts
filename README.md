# Scripts
This repo will hold scripts that I write that I find useful to have.

We'll be using Ruby 2.3.0 for them, because cutting edge.


# CLI Program
Currently envisioning the following usage examples for the CLI app

`athens servers` > Lists all servers connected to it.

`athens servers add/remove/edit [server name] [server address] [server description]` > Add/Remove/Edit Servers that accepts various parameters.

`athens servers new` > Walks you through adding a server to the CLI + bootstrapping a server. Possibly find way to differentiate between Vanilla/Forge/Sponge/Bukkit

`athens servers status/info` > get information from servers connected to it

`athens backup` > backups current directory the command is executed in.

`athens broadcast MESSAGE` > which broadcasts a message to all connected servers

`athens whitelist reload` > gets new whitelist / reloads whitelist on all servers

`athens settings` > List all CLI application settings

`athens settings notifications [enabled/disabled]` > Disable / Enable EMAIL/SMS notifications for errors

`athens login`
